 * The similarity measure should be consistent with equals such that

 * <p>
 * The similarity measure should be reflexive such that
 * {@code compare(a,a) == 1.0}.

 * The similarity measure should be symmetric such that
 * {@code compare(a,b) == compare(b,a)}.

 * The similarity measure may be transitive such that
 * {@code 1.0 - compare(a, c) â‰¤ 1.0 - compare(a, b) + 1.0 - compare(b, c)}
